            <p class="text">You make your way through the forest and are given the option to pick an object up off the floor. This decision is redundant and will not affect the rest of your quest. It is simply a piece of canine feces. At this point, you will be approached by the Black Knight, who will challenge you to a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Your aim is to select the correct weapon, in the hope that it will defeat the Black Knight's choice. This is a completely random battle, and as such, there is so strategy. Sorry to have wasted your time reading this section. It's your own fault for trying to figure out how to win at Rock, Paper, Scissors. Anyway, if you beat the Black Knight, he will offer you his sword as a reward.</p>

            <img id="lion" src="images/lion.png" alt="The Lion">
            <p class="text">As you make your way to the village, you catch sight of Professor Lion 'Mittens' McNaulty IV. You must approach him when given the option to, as this will lead to your untimely death. Declining his help will also lead to your death, so be polite. He's a lion, for crying out loud. Don't annoy him. Anyway, when you take him up on his offer, he will put to you a riddle. Answering this correctly, and Mittens will guide you to a nearby phonebox that will transport you to Septic Meg's castle. If you cannot guess the answer to the riddle, don't worry about it. Consider it WATER of a duck's back.</p>

            <h2>Level 4</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img id="phone" src="images/phone.png" alt="The Phone Box">
            <p class="text">The phonebox will transport you to Septic Meg's castle, only to lock you in until you answer some mental arithmatic questions written on business cards. The answers to these three equations will give you the passcode to unlock the phonebox door, so you can escape. A good strategy to conquer this challenge is to use a calculator. These are portable electronic devices that date back to the 1950s, and were released in various iterations, such as Casio's 14-A calculator, which was built into a desk. More comtemporary models were introduced in the 1960s by numerous manufacturers like Sony and Toshiba, with Texas Instruments pioneering the "pocket calculator" design we all know and love today. Revoluntary design touchstones came about in the years that followed, such as solar-powered calculators that negated the need for batteries, and advanced models that can run other applications such as calendars and games. The calculator is now, of course, taken for granted. Its ubiquious presence in the simplest of devices means it's now easier than ever to make quick calculations, such as the ones in this challenge. If you're still reading this, you could've worked out the code by now. Blimey... okay, the answers are 36, 25, and 19.</p>

            <h2>Level 5</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img id="princess" src="images/princess.png" alt="The Princess">
            <p class="text">As with everybody who escapes a locked phonebox, you are immediately tranquilised when you step outside. When you regain consciousness, you discover you have been captured by the mysterious and unseen villain of your entire adventure, Septic Meg. When Meg offers you a last request, jump at the chance. Otherwise, Meg will kill you. Thankfully, you will be given a chance to spare your life by playing a game of Hangman. Meg has a change of heart, however, and challenges you to a second battle of Rock, Paper, Scissors. If you lose, your life (and presumably the Princess's) will be taken. If you win, however, you will be ordered to hand over the sword you stole from Meg. Luckily, the sword you were presented with by the Black Knight is identical. Offer the sword to Meg, and you and the Princess will be set free. Let's just hope it's the princess you wanted to rescue.</p>
